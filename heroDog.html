          <h3>Rex the Brave</h3>
          <p>
            Rex, a courageous German Shepherd, is a true hero. He protected his
            16-year-old owner during a home invasion. Despite being shot
            multiple times, Rex fought to protect his owner, risking his life in
            the process. Thanks to the quick actions of Officer Jan Magnuson,
            Rex survived and was rushed to safety, where he recovered from his
            injuries.
